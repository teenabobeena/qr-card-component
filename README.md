## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make an image responsive and fit into the design without being stretched or distorted:

```css
main img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp) - This helped me understand how to make an image responsive by setting the width to a percentage and the height to auto, as seen above in the code examples.
